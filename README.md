## Introduction

The **Real-Time Weather Monitoring System** is a Python-based application that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and provides daily weather summaries for major cities in India. It also tracks weather trends, generates visualizations, and issues alerts when specific weather conditions breach user-defined thresholds.

### Target Cities:
- Delhi
- Mumbai
- Chennai
- Bangalore
- Kolkata
- Hyderabad

---

## Features

1. **Real-time weather data retrieval** from OpenWeatherMap API.
2. **Data aggregation and rollups**: Average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and dominant weather conditions for each city.
3. **User-defined thresholds**: Trigger alerts when specific weather conditions are met.
4. **Email alert system** for sending notifications (optional).
5. **Daily summaries** stored in persistent storage (CSV, or databases like SQLite).
6. **Visualization** of daily temperature trends using `matplotlib`.

---

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the application:

### 1. Python
Ensure Python (>= 3.8) is installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official site](https://www.python.org/).

### 2. Python Libraries
Install the required Python libraries by running the following:

```bash
pip install requests pandas schedule smtplib matplotlib
```

### 3. OpenWeatherMap API Key
Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to get a free API key, which you'll need for real-time data retrieval.

### 4. (Optional) Docker
You can containerize the application using Docker. Ensure Docker is installed on your system. You can download Docker from [Docker's official site](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

### 5. SQLite (or any database)
SQLite is used for storing daily weather summaries (or you can switch to a more robust DB like PostgreSQL or MySQL).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-monitoring.git
cd weather-monitoring
```

### 2. Set Up API Key
In the main script, replace the following placeholder with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key:
```python
API_KEY = 'your_openweathermap_api_key'
```

### 3. Run the Application Locally
You can run the application using Python directly:
```bash
python code_test.py
```

### 4. (Optional) Running in Docker
If you'd like to containerize the application:
- Create a `Dockerfile` with the following contents:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /app

COPY . /app

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

CMD ["python", "code_test.py"]
```

- Build and run the Docker container:
```bash
docker build -t weather-monitoring .
docker run -d weather-monitoring
```

### 5. Setting Up the Database (SQLite)
You can use SQLite to store daily weather summaries. This is handled by the application automatically when saving data to CSV files. You can switch to a more advanced DB if needed by modifying the storage logic.

## Running the Application

### Start the application

To run the application and start collecting weather data:
```bash
python code_test.py
```

The system will:
- Fetch weather data at regular intervals (configurable, default is 5 minutes).
- Calculate daily summaries.
- Track and trigger alerts based on user-configurable thresholds.
- Generate weather trend visualizations for each city.

### Viewing the Data
The daily summaries are saved as CSV files in the working directory (e.g., `Delhi_YYYY-MM-DD_weather_summary.csv`).

---

## Design Choices

1. **Language & Framework**:
   - Python was chosen for ease of use, data handling, and wide availability of libraries like `requests`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` for API interaction, data processing, and visualization.

2. **Data Persistence**:
   - **CSV files** are used for daily weather summaries, which can be extended to databases like **SQLite**, **PostgreSQL**, or **MySQL**.
   - The choice of CSV files makes it easier to view, inspect, and share data.

3. **Scheduling**:
   - **Schedule** library is used for regularly fetching weather data and processing daily summaries at midnight. It's lightweight and allows running tasks without needing a complex task scheduler like cron.

4. **Email Alert System**:
   - For alerts, we have a basic email notification system using Python's built-in `smtplib`. This can be extended to include more sophisticated alerting mechanisms like SMS or push notifications.

5. **Visualization**:
   - **Matplotlib** is used for plotting the weather data trends, providing a quick visual understanding of temperature changes over time.

6. **Extensibility**:
   - The system can be easily extended to support more cities, additional weather parameters, forecast data, or even integration with a frontend UI.

## Usage

### Configuration Options

You can configure various parameters inside the script, such as:

1. **Update Interval**: Change how often data is fetched by modifying `MINUTES`:
   ```python
   MINUTES = 5  # Fetch data every 5 minutes
   ```

2. **Threshold Settings**: Configure temperature thresholds to trigger alerts:
   ```python
   TEMP_THRESHOLD = 35  # Celsius
   ALERT_CONSECUTIVE_LIMIT = 2  # Alerts if exceeded in two consecutive updates
   ```

3. **City List**: Add or remove cities to monitor by modifying the `CITIES` list:
   ```python
   CITIES = ['Delhi', 'Mumbai', 'Chennai', 'Bangalore', 'Kolkata', 'Hyderabad']
   ```

### Daily Summary

The system automatically rolls up data for each city at the end of the day, summarizing:
- Average, maximum, minimum temperatures.
- Dominant weather condition.

---

## Visualization

The system includes a plotting function using `matplotlib` to visualize daily weather trends.

To plot temperature trends for a city (e.g., Delhi):
```python
plot_weather_trends('Delhi')
```

---

## Alerting System

The system monitors user-defined weather thresholds (e.g., temperature > 35Â°C for consecutive updates). When these thresholds are breached, the system triggers an alert and sends a notification via email (if configured).

---

## Test Cases

### 1. **System Setup**:
   - Verify the system starts correctly and connects to the OpenWeatherMap API with a valid API key.
  
### 2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Simulate API calls and ensure that weather data is retrieved and stored for each city.

### 3. **Temperature Conversion**:
   - Check the correctness of temperature conversion from Kelvin to Celsius.

### 4. **Daily Weather Summary**:
   - Simulate weather data and verify correct daily summary generation, including averages, max, min, and dominant weather condition.

### 5. **Alerting Thresholds**:
   - Simulate threshold breaches and check if alerts are triggered appropriately.

## Conclusion

This weather monitoring system is a versatile, extensible tool for tracking real-time weather conditions and receiving alerts for extreme conditions. With easy configurability and built-in visualization, it's a robust solution for monitoring weather trends in major Indian cities.
